# coursera_capstone_project_20191209
This is a capstone project for a course, "Machine Learning with Python". The course is part of the "IBM Data Science Professional Certificate" program at Coursera. This project presents a notebook that highlights steps in building a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off. A historical dataset from previous loan applications is collected, cleaned, and various classification algorithms such as kNN, Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression are then applied. Accuracy metrics such as Jaccard index, F1-score, and LogLoss are reported for each classifier.
